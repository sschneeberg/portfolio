    "I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and a certificate from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.  I have experience with object oriented programming in Python and JavaScript and with full stack development from RESTful API design to responsive frontend experiences. Prior to shifting my focus to software development, I worked in the Washington DC theater scene. I worked primarily as a technical director and scenic designer, becoming a trusted collaborator for local companies.";

    'I have had the incredible opportunity to support artists of diverse backgrounds both artistically and logistically. I learned how to operate with individuals of varying perspectives and have learned from them in return. As a freelancer, I took on concurrent projects, employing frequent communication with each organization alongside thorough, advanced planning. I developed a strong sense of time management, a foundation of project management skills, and built professional experience interfacing with cross disciplinary teams.';

const statement3 =
    'I strive to face every interaction with fairness and understanding.  Like any human being, I will often act in accordance with my emotions.  However, I have a penchant for reflection.  I think it is important to understand your place in the world: your trials, your abilities, and your privileges.  In turn you must recognize these in others; I consider the context behind someone elseâ€™s actions before taking my own. I stand back and evaluate before action, but I still believe it is important to speak up when you see an issue.';

const statement4 =
    'I believe you should not shy away from confrontation, because I do not think confrontation is a synonym for conflict.  To confront something is to deal with it, to meet it head on and tackle the challenge of improving the situation.  There need not be conflict if you can approach situations with understanding and open yourself to conversation.  I see empathy and communication as the key to successful collaboration.  If you can incorporate the mindset of your peers and allow them to see yours, cooperation becomes seamless with supervisors, coworkers and clients.';
