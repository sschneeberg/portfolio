My recent professional experience as an early career Scenic Designer and Technical Director has given me the chance to work with numerous local DC theater companies.  Through theater I have had the incredible opportunity to support artists of diverse backgrounds and support their needs artistically and logistically.';

I have developed a strong sense of time management, a foundation of project management skills, and professional experience interfacing with cross disciplinary teams.';

    'I strive to face every interaction with fairness and understanding.  Like any human being, I will act in accordance with my emotions.  However, I have a penchant for reflection.  I think it is important to understand your place in the world: your struggles, your abilities, your privileges.  In turn you must recognize these in others; I consider the context behind someone elseâ€™s actions before taking my own.  While I stand back and evaluate before action, I still believe it is important to speak up when you see an issue.';

const statement4 =
    'I do not shy away from confrontation, as I do not see confrontation as synonymous with conflict.  To confront something is to deal with it, to meet it head on and tackle the challenge of improving the situation.  There need not be conflict if you can approach situations with understanding and open yourself to conversation.  I see empathy and communication as the key to successful collaboration.  If you can incorporate the mindset of your peers and allow them to see yours, cooperation becomes seamless with supervisors, coworkers and clients.';
